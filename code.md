Hey everyone, 
Just wanted to take a moment to answer a couple of questions I noticed recently. 

:one:  what does "maturing in 14 days" mean?
Hacktoberfest give maintainers 14 days to mark any pull requests they do not feel matches the standards required as spam or invalid. If your PR is merged and does not receive an invalid or spam label, it will "mature" and you will be accredited for your contribution towards Hacktoberfest. 

:two:  Why are PRs is marked as invalid in ZTM repos?
If you are unfortunate enough to have your PR marked as invalid, this usually means one of two things. 
 - You created a pull request which only adds your name to a file, whilst this is perfectly fine, we are obligated to mark it as invalid or we risk having the repo blacklisted for Hacktoberfest. 
 - You changes the wording of the documentation, that really added no value to the project. Again we are obligated to mark this as an invalid contribution. If you are unsure of what you can contribute to a project use #hacktoberfest-chat to discuss the project and find ideas. 

If you are unsure about why your PR was marked as invalid, feel free to DM me with the PR url and I will be more than happy to look into this.

:three:  Why hasn't my PR been merged yet?
Each PR can take anywhere from 2 - 15 minutes to check and validate. If a PR has a merge conflict or large file changes, this increases the turn around time. With only a handful of volunteer maintainers, this process can unfortunately take some time. But rest assured we are actively working to merge your PRs in.
